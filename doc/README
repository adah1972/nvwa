                         === Stones of Nvwa ===

The Name

  Nvwa ("v" is pronounced like the French "u"), is one of the most
  ancient Chinese goddesses.  She was said to have created human beings,
  and, when the evil god Gong-gong crashed himself upon one of the
  pillars that support the sky and made a hole in it, she repaired the
  sky with five-coloured stones.

  I thought of the name Nvwa by analogy with Loki.  Since it is so small
  a project and it contains utilities instead of a complete framework, I
  think "stones" a good metaphor.


Code Organization

  Some may think that it is better to include like "#include <nvwa/...>".
  However, I have reasons to avoid that.  I would like to make the Nvwa
  files drop-ins for other projects.  One may simply copy them and use
  them.  It is not necessary to keep them in a separate directory -- of
  course, not doing so will make it difficult to do cvs update.

  Some may also wonder why I do not put the contents in namespace nvwa
  instead of the global one.  Um, some stuff, say, debug_new, simply
  cannot be put in a namespace.  And the copy-and-use usage pattern also
  prevents me from doing that.  But this is not unchangeable.  Other
  opinions, especially those resulting from real usage, are welcome.


Contents

  A brief introduction follows.  Check the Doxygen documentation for
  more (technical) details.

  * boolarray.cpp
  * boolarray.h

   A replacement of std::vector<bool>.  I wrote it before I knew of
   vector<bool>, or I might not have written it at all.  However, it is
   faster than any vector<bool> implementation I know, and it has
   members like at, set, reset, flip, and count.  I myself find "count"
   very useful.

  * class_level_lock.h

   The Loki ClassLevelLockable adapted to use the fast_mutex layer.  One
   minor divergence from Loki is that the template has an additional
   template parameter _RealLock to boost the performance in non-locking
   scenarios.  In that case, if you have a decent compiler, you probably
   want to define HAS_CLASS_TEMPLATE_PARTIAL_SPECIALIZATION to 1 for
   even better optimization.  Cf. object_level_lock.h.

  * cont_ptr_utils.h

   Utility functors for containers of pointers adapted from Scott Meyers'
   Effective STL.

  * debug_new.cpp
  * debug_new.h

   A cross-platform, thread-safe memory leak detector.  It is a
   light-weight one designed only to catch unmatched pairs of
   new/delete.  I know there are already many existing memory leak
   detectors, but as far as I know, free solutions are generally slow,
   memory-consuming, and quite complicated to use.  This solution is
   very easy to use, and has very low space/time overheads.  Just link
   in debug_new.cpp for leakage report, and include debug_new.h for
   additional file/line information.  It will automatically switch on
   multi-threading when the appropriate option of a recognized compiler
   is specified.  Check fast_mutex.h for more threading details.

   Special support for gcc/binutils has been added to debug_new lately.
   Even if the header file debug_new.h is not included, or
   _DEBUG_NEW_REDEFINE_NEW is defined to 0 when it is included,
   file/line information can be displayed if debugging symbols are
   present in the executable, since debug_new stores the caller
   addresses of memory allocation/deallocation routines and they will be
   converted with addr2line on the fly.  This makes memory tracing much
   easier.

   With an idea from Greg Herlihy’s post in comp.lang.c++.moderated, the
   implementation was much improved in 2007.  The most significant
   result is that placement new can be used with debug_new now!  Full
   support for new(std::nothrow) is provided, with its null-returning
   error semantics (by default).  Memory corruption will be checked on
   freeing the pointers and checking the leaks, and a new function
   check_mem_corruption is added for your on-demand use in debugging.
   You may also want to define _DEBUG_NEW_TAILCHECK to something like 4
   for past-end memory corruption check, which is off by default to
   ensure performance is not affected.

   NOTE for GCC 3.x users:  Unless you are using a very old GCC 3.x
   release (before 3.2.2), most probably you would want to define the
   environment variable GLIBCPP_FORCE_NEW ("set GLIBCPP_FORCE_NEW=1" in
   Windows command prompt and "export GLIBCPP_FORCE_NEW=1" in BASH, for
   example) to get precise results of leak reports; otherwise the memory
   pooling in libstdc++-v3 could cause false positives.  I do not know
   of the status of GCC 3.2.1, but I do know that 3.0.x, 3.1.x, and 3.2
   do NOT support this method (but one is not supposed to be still using
   those interim releases, right?  I personally test mostly on GCC
   2.95.3, 3.2.3, and 3.4.2 now). -- For GCC 3.4 and later, the variable
   name is changed to GLIBCXX_FORCE_NEW.

  * fast_mutex.h

   The threading transparent layer simulating a non-recursive mutex.  It
   supports POSIX threads and Win32 threads currently, as well as a
   no-threads mode.  Unlike Loki and some other libraries, threading
   mode is not to be specified in code, but detected from the
   environment.  It will automatically switch on multi-threading when
   the "-MT"/"-MD" option of MSVC, the "-mthreads" option of MinGW GCC,
   or the "-pthread" option of GCC under POSIX environments, is used.
   One advantage of the current implementation is that the construction
   and destruction of a static object using a static fast_mutex not yet
   constructed or already destroyed are allowed to work (with
   lock/unlock operations ignored), and there are re-entry checks for
   lock/unlock operations when the preprocessing symbol _DEBUG is
   defined.

  * fixed_mem_pool.h

   A memory pool implementation that requires initialization (allocates
   a fixed-size chunk) prior to its use.  It is simple and makes no
   memory fragmentation, but the memory pool size cannot be changed
   after initialization.  Macros are provided to easily make a class use
   pooled new/delete.

  * mem_pool_base.cpp
  * mem_pool_base.h

   A class solely to be inherited by memory pool implementations.  It is
   used by static_mem_pool and fixed_mem_pool.

  * object_level_lock.h

   The Loki ObjectLevelLockable adapted to use the fast_mutex layer.
   The member function get_locked_object does not exist in Loki, but is
   also taken from Mr Alexandrescu's article.  Cf. class_level_lock.h.

  * pctimer.h

   A function to get a high-resolution timer for Win32/Cygwin/Unix.  It
   is quite useful for measurement and optimization.

  * set_assign.h

   Utility routines to make up for the fact that STL only has set_union
   (+) and set_difference (-) algorithms but no corresponding += and -=
   operations available.

  * static_mem_pool.cpp
  * static_mem_pool.h

   A memory pool implementation to pool memory blocks according to
   compile-time block sizes.  Macros are provided to easily make a class
   use pooled new/delete.
